To compile the program, run "make".

To run the program, use "./Main <mem-file> <cache-size> <assoc-config> <mode>"

Where...
 - <mem-file> is the path to the memory trace file (String)
 - <cache-size> is the size of the cache in KB (Int)
 - <assoc-config> is the type of association configuration (Int)
 - <mode> is the mode of the memory replacement algorithm. 0 is LRU and 1 is LFU.

 The program can also be run with just "./Main <mem-file>".
 <mem-file> is the same as above and the default settings will be...
 <cache-size> = 128
 <assoc-config> = 4
 <mode> = 0

 The script "testing_script.sh" was used to run tests on the 3 mem trace files with different parameters
